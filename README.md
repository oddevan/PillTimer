PillTimer
=========

PillTimer *will be* a basic iOS app to manage medicine doses. Right now it's still being worked on.

Seriously.

No really, that's all there is. It doesn't work yet. I don't even have my developer certificate yet. It's only here because I need to get used to using source control for my personal projects, and it's only public because I don't feel like paying for GitHub just yet.

If you must have a license, it's MIT. Now I must go get back to coding.
