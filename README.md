### Introducing PillTimer

This is an app to keep track of medicine doses. Most medicine has two parts to dosage instructions: the interval between doses (often 4, 6, or 12 hours) and a daily limit to doses. Given this information, PillTimer will keep track of the doses you've taken in the past 24 hours and alert you when it is okay to take another dose.

This app is entirely self-contained. Your information is NEVER transmitted across the internet or recorded longer than necessary for the app to function.

### About

This app was built as a personal exercise by [Evan Hildreth](http://eph.me/) (a.k.a. [oddEvan](http://www.oddevan.com/)) and beta-tested by his amazing wife [Brittany Hildreth](http://twitter.com/britthildreth).
