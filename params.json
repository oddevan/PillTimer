{"name":"PillTimer","tagline":"A basic iOS app to manage medicine doses","body":"### Introducing PillTimer\r\n\r\nThis is an app to keep track of medicine doses. Most medicine has two parts to dosage instructions: the interval between doses (often 4, 6, or 12 hours) and a daily limit to doses. Given this information, PillTimer will keep track of the doses you've taken in the past 24 hours and alert you when it is okay to take another dose.\r\n\r\nThis app is entirely self-contained. Your information is NEVER transmitted across the internet or recorded longer than necessary for the app to function.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nYou can get support via twitter by mentioning [@PillTimerApp](http://twitter.com/pilltimerapp). You can also send an email to <pilltimer@oddevan.com>. If you're familiar with GitHub's issue tracking, you can [create an issue](http://github.com/oddevan/PillTimer/issues).\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n![You may take a dose now](http://s3.eph.me/pilltimer/3-Yes.PNG) ![You may not take a dose now](http://s3.eph.me/pilltimer/3-No.PNG) ![Record a new dose](http://s3.eph.me/pilltimer/3-New.PNG) ![Settings](http://s3.eph.me/pilltimer/3-Back.PNG)\r\n### About\r\n\r\nThis app was built as a personal exercise by [Evan Hildreth](http://eph.me/) (a.k.a.
